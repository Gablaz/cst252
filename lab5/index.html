				<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We did not really encounter any problems while working on this lab.
						We followed along with Task 1 in the class demonstration and adjusted
						it to fit the lab instructions. The index.html and JavaScript files
						were already available in our copied cst252 template and we continued
						to work through each section of the lab.</p>

			<section id="results">
				<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>n the end, we created variables to hold data about our primary
						methods of transportation in the Chrome console and declared the
						variables in our lab5.js file. We linked our JavaScript file to our
						index.html file and created a page displaying our script output and
						an image of our vehicle.</p>
