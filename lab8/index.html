				<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We did not really encounter any problems while working on this lab.
						The index.html and JavaScript files were already available in our
						copied cst252 template and we continued to work through each section
						of the lab. We referred to the provided screenshots in the lab
						instructions along with the work we did during the in-class
						demonstration.</p>

			<section id="results">
				<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>In the end, we successfully experimented with anonymous functions
						and callbacks. We experimented in the console to create anonymous
						functions that performed an operation on an array. We then added our
						working code to our lab.js files and used console.log() to print out
						our results. Our results can be seen on our working pages within the
						console.</p>
