					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The purpose of this lab was to create a local file structure on our
						computers, add index.html files, and upload them to the server.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="problems">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We did not encounter too many problems. We both already had a local
						file structure and and index.html files created due to downloading
						the cst252 repo during “installfest.” Any difficulties we
						encountered occurred while experimenting with CSS. Luckily, we
						referenced W3 schools and were able to solve our issues.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="results">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>We each have an organized local file structure and created
						index.html files styled with CSS.</p>
