				<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to experiment with JavaScript events
						and forms.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="problems">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We did not really encounter too many problems while working on this
						lab. The index.html and JavaScript files were already available in
						our copied cst252 template and we continued to work through each
						section of the lab. We referred to the lab instructions and the work
						we did during the in-class demonstration. We had a brief problem
						trying to figure out how to run our input through our Lab 7 function
						as well as how to format our JavaScript, but we referred to the
						example and JavaScript available on
						https://wmodes.github.io/cst252/lab10/index.html. Looking at the
						proper format and JavaScript process allowed us to better understand
						the assigned task and helped us write our own JavaScript.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="results">
				<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>In the end, we successfully created a input form field and button
						in HTML where the user can enter and submit their name to the site.
						We then attached an event listener to the button that gets the value
						of our input field and runs the value through our sort function from
						Lab 7. The JavaScript then returns and replaces the output
						with the sorted version of the userâ€™s name.</p>
