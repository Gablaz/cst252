				<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was experiment with basic JavaScript
						arrays and objects using the Google Chrome console and Atom.</p>

				<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We did not really encounter any problems while working on this lab.
						We followed along with Task 1 in the class demonstration along with
						the lab instructions. The index.html and JavaScript files were
						already available in our copied cst252 template and we continued to
						work through each section of the lab. We did have a slight problem
						with having our linked js file appear in our browser, but we
						referred to W3schools and resolved the issue.</p>

				<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>In the end, we declared arrays and objects to hold data about our
						primary methods of transportation in the Chrome console and in our
						lab6.js file. We linked our JavaScript file to our index.html file
						and created a page displaying our script output and an image of our
						vehicle.</p>
