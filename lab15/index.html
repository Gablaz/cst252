					<p>The challenge of this lab was to use our newfound debugging
						knowledge to fix our old labs and assignments.</p>

				<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We did not encounter too many problems while working on this lab.
						The debugging techniques we learned allowed us to break down various

				<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>In the end, we successfully reviewed our past labs and used our
						newfound debugging knowledge to find errors in our code and solve
						any past problems.</p>

				<h2>Debugging</h2>
					<p>For this assignment, I did not feel that I had any major problems
						in my past labs that needed to be solved or debugged. Throughout the
						semester, I have worked to resolve the issues in my code before I
						submit the labs, and so far, I have been able to submit my
						assignments with minimal errors, correct output, and good style.
						However, the Lab 15 lecture did enable me to put words to my problem
						solving techniques and allowed me to better understand how to break
						down issues in my code in an organized and efficient manner. I
						decided to go back to labs that I struggled with and analyze the
						problem solving and debugging techniques I used to resolve the
						issues I had at the time.</p>

								<p>These are screenshots of my work for Lab 6: Arrays and
									Objects. I remember that during this lab I was having an issue
									having my js file appear in my browser. In order to solve the
									issue, I remember using a variation of the “Rubber Ducking”
									debugging strategy to solve the problem. My partner and I
									began to talk about the issue aloud and walk through our steps
									in order to figure out what went wrong. We referred back to
									our lecture notes and the work we did during the in-class lab.
									Eventually, we had to ask for help and referred to W3 schools
									as well as our lecture notes. We then figured out that in
									order for our output to appear in the browser, we needed to
									use term document.writeln is then used to print the array and
									the term JSON.stringify is used to display the object.</p>

								<p>These are screenshots of my work for Lab 6: Arrays and
									Objects. The purpose of this lab was to experiment with adding
									and modifying new elements to our pages with JavaScript. I
									remember that I had an issue with appending my button
									variables to my output variables. In order to solve this issue
									I remember trying to comment out certain sections of my code
									in order to see what the specific problem was. In the end, we
									had to ask my friend Amanda for help and she showed me how she
									resolved a similar issue and I was able to apply her
									instructions to my own code.</p>

								<p>These are screenshots of my work for Lab 14: Loops. This was
									definitely one of the more challenging labs. The purpose of
									the assignment was to experiment with loops in JavaScript. I
									remember that our main issue was getting our JavaScript to
									appear in our browser. Our code worked within the console, but
									we had to ask our friend Amanda for assistance in creating a
									new DOM element for each number within the loop and appending
									our elements to the output div. Once we figured out that issue
									I continued to experiment with the code for the bonus task. In
									order to complete that section of the lab, I used the
									debugging methods of “rubber ducking,” commenting out code,
									and writing a test in order to develop a working script for
									the lab.</p>
