				<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We encountered a few challenges while working on this lab. Our main
						issue was getting our JavaScript to appear in our browser. Our code
						worked within the console, but we had to ask our friend Amanda for
						assistance in creating a new DOM element for each number within the
						loop and appending our elements to the output div. Other than that,
						we referred to the lab instructions and the work we did while
						following along with the in-class demonstration in order to complete
						the lab.. The in-class demonstration was very helpful in this lab
						and we depended heavily on the notes we took during the
						demonstration.</p>

				<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>In the end, we were able to list and loop through numbers 1-200. If
						any of the numbers were a multiple of 3, 5, or 7 we were able to
						replace the number with the word Fizz, Buzz, or Boom
						respectively.</p>
