				<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The purpose of this lab was to begin thinking in terms of
						pseudocoding. We were instructed to pseudocode an everyday task and
						pseudocode a possible computer task.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="problems">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We ran into the small problem of figuring out what kind of computer
						task we wanted to pseudocode. It was difficult selecting a game,
						task, or automation without knowing how such tasks should be broken
						down when programming. However, after some research and contemplation,
						we selected a simple computer task that we felt comfortable dividing
						into high-level tasks.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="results">
				<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>We successfully outlined and pseudocoded an everyday task as well
						as a computer task. The pseudocode for the everyday task describes
						the process behind making an apple pie, and the pseudocode for the
						computer task describes a program asking for the user's name in order to
						create a personalized greeting. We turned both outlines into comments
						in our lab.js folder and included them in our lab4/index.html as well.
						Finally, we published our lab4 pages to the server.</p>
