				<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We did not really encounter too many problems while working on this
						lab. The index.html and JavaScript files were already available in
						our copied cst252 template and we continued to work through each
						section of the lab. We referred to the lab instructions and the work
						we did during the in-class demonstration. We had a brief problem
						trying to get append our oneEl and twoEl variables to our outputEl
						Variable, but we asked our friend Amanda for help and we fixed the
						issue.</p>

				<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>In the end, we successfully added and stylized two buttons to our
						webpage using JavaScript.</p>
