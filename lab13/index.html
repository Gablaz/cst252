				<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to create a function that depends on
						conditionals.</p>

				<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We did not really encounter any problems while working on this lab.
						The index.html and JavaScript files were already available in our
						copied cst252 template, and we continued to work through each
						section of the lab. We referred to the lab instructions and the work
						we did while following along with the in-class demonstration. The
						in-class demonstration was very helpful in this lab and we depended
						heavily on the notes we took during the demonstration.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="results">
				<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>In the end, we successfully created a Sorting Hat function that
						depends on conditionals related to the user’s input. Our function
						sorts their user into their Hogwarts house, depending on the length
						of the user’s name.</p>
