				<p>Hello there! I am Gabby Lazarcheff! I am from Oakhurst, CA, which is a
				small town right outside Yosemite National Park, and I am a
				Communications Design Major with a concentration in Visual Design. Art
				has always been a big part of my life! I love music, crafts, drawing,
				and journaling. I also love to listen to audiobooks and watch movies.
				I am very excited for this course, and I am looking forward to learning
				more complex programming and scripting content. I hope to use the skills
				I learn within this class for my future design projects throughout
				college and in my future as designer. My partner for this lab is Jonathon
				Castanon. We met in our freshman year at CSUMB and have had many CST and
				design classes together since then. We are both comfortable in our design
				skills and have experience with HTML and CSS.</p>
