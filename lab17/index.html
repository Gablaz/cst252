				<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to experiment and explore Object
						Oriented Design.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="problems">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We did not encounter too many problems while working on this lab.
						We referred to the lab instructions and the work we did while
						following along with the in-class demonstration in order to complete
						the lab. We followed the provided lecture notes and talked out our
						pseudocode for a hangman game.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="results">
				<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>In the end, we successfully created an OOP for the game hangman. We
						started by making a higher level pseudocode to help us understand
						the concept better. From there we manipulated the objects to have
						actions. </p>

				<h2>OOP Design: Hangman</h2>
					<h3>1. Understand the problem</h3>
<pre>
Set up the game and include gallows and players
Prompt Player 1 for word
Display length of word
Prompt Player 2 for letter guess
Validate Player 2 input
Check if guess matches any of the letters within the word
</pre>
					<h3>2. Pseudocode the High Level Approach</h3>
<pre>
Set up the game initially
  Create hangman gallows
  Create a players
	Render gallows
	Establish 6 lives for Player 2
	Prompt Player one for word
	Validate input and display number of letters as underscores
Start the game loop
	Prompt Player 2 for letter guess
	Validate guess and check with word
	If the guess matches
		Replace corresponding underscore with letter
		Keep looping
	Else
		Remove one life
		Keep looping
	If all letters are guessed
		Display Victory Message
		Stop looping
	If lives equal 0
		Display "Game Over"
		Stop Looping
	</pre>
					<h3>3. Assign Actions to Objects</h3>
<pre>
Set up the game initially [Hangman]
  Create hangman gallows [Gallows]
  Create a players [Player]
	Render gallows [Gallows]
	Establish 6 lives for Player 2 [Player]
	Prompt Player one for word [Player]
	Validate input and display number of letters as underscores [Player]
Start the game loop [Hangman]
	Prompt Player 2 for letter guess [Player]
	Validate guess and check with word [Player]
		If the guess matches [Hangman]
		 	Replace corresponding underscore with letter
			Keep looping
		Else [Hangman]
		 	Remove one life
			Keep looping
		If all letters are guessed[ Hangman]
			Display Victory Message
			Stop looping
		If lives equal 0 [Hangman]
			Display "Game Over"
			Stop Looping
	</pre>
					<h3>4. Make Javascript-ish Pseudocode</h3>
<pre>
// Controls the game play class Hangman
	// initialize
		// set up gallows
		// set up players
		// assign variable lives
		// prompt player 1 for word and store in array
		// display new, equal numbered array with characters as underscores
	// Play
		//loop
			// prompt player 2 for letter
			// test if input matches original word/array
				// if true, relace undersore with letter
				// if false, decrese variable "lives" by 1
		// check victory
			// if string is = original string
			// stop loop, display victory message
		// check game over
			// if lives = 0
			// stop loop, display game over message
</pre>
